# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Bring sorting algorithms to life with this interactive Python visualizer. Watch real-time animations of Bubble, Merge, Quick Sort, and more, as data bars highlight each step. This tool is perfect for students and developers to visually compare the logic, speed, and efficiency (O(nlogn) vs O(n  2  )) of fundamental algorithms.
